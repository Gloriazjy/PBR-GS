Abstract: *Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has facilitated the development of real-time generation of high-quality new perspective synthesis. However, when applied to the reconstruction of complex indoor 3D scenes, especially when the global light in the scene interacts with different material surfaces, it still faces challenges such as reflection deformation and discontinuity of irregular smooth surfaces, and the deviation of light scattering in semi-transparent media from the actual situation. To address the above problems, this paper proposes PBR-GS on the basis of 3DGS, which integrates the theory of microfacet modeling, and constructs a physically-based rendering (PBR) decoupled computing system by assigning each Gaussian ellipsoid with a set of physical illumination parameters, such as normal vector, roughness, metallicity, and albedo. The diffuse reflection term, specular reflection term, and ambient light are modeled respectively to better simulate the reflective polarization difference of different material interfaces and the anisotropic scattering attenuation process of the rough surface in the indoor complex light field, so as to realize the physical consistency simulation of the light transmission and the high-fidelity rendering of the material details. Experimental results demonstrate that the method in this paper can better simulate the phenomena of reflection, scattering, and ambient light masking on different material surfaces in the room than the comparison methods, and present a more realistic quality of details.*


### Hardware Requirements

- CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+
- 24 GB VRAM (to train to paper evaluation quality)
- Please see FAQ for smaller VRAM configurations

### Software Requirements
- Conda (recommended for easy setup)
- C++ Compiler for PyTorch extensions (we used Visual Studio 2019 for Windows)
- CUDA SDK 11 for PyTorch extensions, install *after* Visual Studio (we used 11.8, **known issues with 11.6**)
- C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK must be compatible

### Setup

#### Local Setup

Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```shell
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```
Please note that this process assumes that you have CUDA SDK **11** installed, not **12**. For modifications, see below.


### Running

To run the optimizer, simply use

```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset>
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for train.py</span></summary>

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --model_path / -m 
  Path where the trained model should be stored (```output/<random>``` by default).
  #### --images / -i
  Alternative subdirectory for COLMAP images (```images``` by default).
  #### --eval
  Add this flag to use a MipNeRF360-style training/test split for evaluation.
  #### --resolution / -r
  Specifies resolution of the loaded images before training. If provided ```1, 2, 4``` or ```8```, uses original, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, respectively. For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. **If not set and input image width exceeds 1.6K pixels, inputs are automatically rescaled to this target.**
  #### --data_device
  Specifies where to put the source image data, ```cuda``` by default, recommended to use ```cpu``` if training on large/high-resolution dataset, will reduce VRAM consumption, but slightly slow down training. Thanks to [HrsPythonix](https://github.com/HrsPythonix).
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --sh_degree

  #### --convert_cov3D_python
  Flag to make pipeline compute forward and backward of the 3D covariance with PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --debug
  Enables debug mode if you experience erros. If the rasterizer fails, a ```dump``` file is created that you may forward to us in an issue so we can take a look.
  #### --debug_from
  Debugging is **slow**. You may specify an iteration (starting from 0) after which the above debugging becomes active.
  #### --iterations
  Number of total iterations to train for, ```30_000``` by default.
  #### --ip
  IP to start GUI server on, ```127.0.0.1``` by default.
  #### --port 
  Port to use for GUI server, ```6009``` by default.
  #### --test_iterations
  Space-separated iterations at which the training script computes L1 and PSNR over test set, ```7000 30000``` by default.
  #### --save_iterations
  Space-separated iterations at which the training script saves the Gaussian model, ```7000 30000 <iterations>``` by default.
  #### --checkpoint_iterations
  Space-separated iterations at which to store a checkpoint for continuing later, saved in the model directory.
  #### --start_checkpoint
  Path to a saved checkpoint to continue training from.
  #### --quiet 
  Flag to omit any text written to standard out pipe. 
  #### --feature_lr
  Spherical harmonics features learning rate, ```0.0025``` by default.
  #### --opacity_lr
  Opacity learning rate, ```0.05``` by default.

### Evaluation
By default, the trained models use all available images in the dataset. To train them while withholding a test set for evaluation, use the ```--eval``` flag. This way, you can render training/test sets and produce error metrics as follows:
```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> --eval # Train with train/test split
python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
```

  #### --skip_test
  Flag to skip rendering the test set.
  #### --quiet 
  Flag to omit any text written to standard out pipe.

  #### --source_path / -s
